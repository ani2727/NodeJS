//How versioning works in NodeJS

I)let us take example version : ^4.18.2 
3rd part --> 2
2nd part --> 18
1st part --> 4

3rd part(Last part) --> Minor Fixes(Optional)
2nd part            --> Recommended Bug fix(Security Fix)
1st part            --> Major Release/ Breaking update

And the symbol "^" means Compatible with version i.e it can update all the minor updates of the current version (2nd part,3rd part).
It automatically downloads the recent updates like 4.18.3,4.18.4 ...
But it cannot update 5.0.0 because it is a majot release

II) version: ~4.18.2 --> Approximately equivalent to version.
i.e 4.18.2, 4.18.3, 4.18.4 are ok but 4.19.0 is not allowed with that symbol

III) version: 4.18.2 --> it represent the current version is locked and no minor or major updates will be take place.

IV) version: latest --> respresent everytime the latest version is updated.
  But this will cause a problem if in case of long term commitment because the codes cannot work on the updated versions every time.

And there are many other ways of representing a version like 1.0.0 - 2.0.0(range) or >1.0.0, etc...
