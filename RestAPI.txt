RestAPI or RestFullAPI
----------------------

           Request
Server <---------------- Client(Mobile,Browser,Alexa)
       ----------------> 
           Response
       
I) REST API works on server client architecture which means server and client are two different entities without any dependencies.

Here, The response can be of any form(html doc,Json,Image,Text)
If the response received is of html doc then if the client is browser then it is OK but what if it is mobile or alexa.
And here we are deciding in which format the date should be retrieved (Here the client is dependent on server but in RESTFULL API it is not going to happen).

To perform this: 
1) We can do SERVER SIDE RENDERING(SSR) i.e we create the html doc at server itself and will be receiving as response.
2) JSON(JavaScript Object Notation) --> Key:Value pairs.

If the client is browser then it is good to send html doc as data.
But if the client is mobile,alexa or something then it is good to have JSON data.

II) Always respect the HTTP methods.
  Get/user - get User data
  Post - handle new user creation
  Put 
  Patch
  Delete

  Post - updateUser //why to use post method for update instead of using patch. This is not effective also creates a confusion.
  Post - createuser // same with this line 
But in RestFull API we have to give importance to every http method equally.
